## Project Structure:

### 1. Initial Data Cleaning & EDA:

**Objective:** Understand the dataset and identify patterns for customer retention.

**Steps:**
- Loaded the dataset and performed an initial exploration.
- Addressed missing values and outliers.
- Visualized key features using plots and heatmaps.

### 2. Model Building and Comparison:

**Objective:** Develop predictive models and compare their performance.

**Approach:**
- Built five different models to assess their individual strengths.
- Evaluated performance metrics to identify top-performing models.
- Focused on the top two models (XGBoost & Random Forest) for further analysis.

### 3. Feature Engineering and Data Wrangling:

**Objective:** Enhance model performance through feature engineering.

**Approach:**
- Explored and created new features based on domain knowledge.
- Conducted further data wrangling to improve data quality.
- Applied feature scaling and transformation techniques.

### 4. Model Building and Fine-Tuning:

**Objective:** Optimize the top models using advanced techniques.

**Approach:**
- Implemented LightGBM and integrated it into the ensemble.
- Conducted Cross-Validation Grid Search for hyperparameter tuning.
- Finalized the ensemble model for optimal performance.

## Results:

- **F1 Score:** Achieved an F1 score of 0.69, ranking in the top 20 globally.
- **Approach & Methodology:** Demonstrated a robust methodology for model development and fine-tuning.
- **Verbal Presentation:** Prepared to communicate findings and methodology effectively.
